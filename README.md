# Diamond Square Algorithm
![Powered By Java](http://tekeye.uk/programming/images/java_powered.png)

Diamond Square is mainly used for terrain generation. I am sure there is another use out there that I don't know. This implementation was written in Java but it can easily be converted to other languages...

Best explanation of Diamond Square Algorithm can be found on wiki page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm

This implementation is fully open-sourced feel free to use and change however you want. I have created this for a game project I was working on. It is suitable for 3D games as well as tile based 2D games.

# Features
- Calculates a height map with chunks (double) 
- Can scale a height map between 0 and X for easier implementation.

# Example Application
The example application demostrates this script in action with Swing library.
